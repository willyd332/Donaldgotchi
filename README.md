### Description:

Donaldgotchi was my first ever coding project. I started it one week after first starting to code. Before then I had zero previous experience with any programming, developement, or design. 

The game itself is a fun simulation of Trump in the whitehouse. I learned jQuery, CSS, HTML, and Javascript during the first week of a intensive software engineering course with General Assembly, and then I made this game in about 2 days.
